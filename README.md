# class-scorecard-app
This scorecard app is a pleasure for teachers. A teacher can enter a list of students with his or her test score and see a summary of his class performance. Summary includes Min, Max, and Average score. List supports CRUD operations on student's name and score.

List supports in-line editing of student name and score, such that changing a test score updates the model and class report statistics.

List validates user input and students with a score < 65 get highlighted to indicate a failing grade.
